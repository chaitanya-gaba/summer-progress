    <h2>🌿 Chapter 1: That Random Saturday</h2>
    <p>
     It was just a random Saturday. I was drinking with Sir, but in my mind, it was you. Every laugh, every sip, every pause somehow circled back to you. You know how I get after drinking — a little lost, a little too honest. That night, I wanted to kiss you, but I couldn’t. By Monday, the thought still wouldn’t leave my mind. Everyone at the office kept teasing us, and somehow, it felt real. Then came that long call — the one that didn’t end, the one that felt like forever. I can’t explain it, but talking to you felt like peace. Maybe that night was the start of something. 💫

    <h2>🍃 Chapter 2: The Day Everything Changed</h2>
    <p>
    For the next four days, we talked a lot — every night, every break, every moment somehow found its way back to us. Then came the office plan — a trip to Gurgaon. I didn’t know that day would stay with me forever.

On the way there, the way you touched me .I can’t describe it, but it felt right. Warm. Safe. The kind of comfort you don’t have to explain. You kept checking on me, worried because I was wearing heels — asking again and again, “Tum theek ho na?” And even though I didn’t say much, inside I was melting a little every time you cared.

After the meeting, everyone decided we should go out for drinks, but somehow things changed and we had to head back to the hotel. And that night 13th October something shifted. We kissed.

I can’t forget that day. No matter how much time passes, that moment still lives quietly inside me. 💫

    <h2>☕ Chapter 3: The Night That Changed Everything</h2>
    <p>
     After that evening, we kept talking — laughing softly, waiting for everyone else to fall asleep. You were in the other room, I was in mine, and yet it felt like our thoughts were already together. Around 1 a.m., you came to my room — Room 408. That night, everything changed. The way we held each other, the warmth, the calm — it felt like home.

The next day, after the shoot, we left for Hisar. But something inside me was different now. That night, we talked again, and somehow, the distance between us kept shrinking. I found myself craving your presence — your touch, your care. I think that’s when I realized… I was falling for you. 💞

    <h2>🌙 Chapter 4: The Eyes That Spoke Everything</h2>
    <p>
     At the Diwali party, the way you looked at me it was different. I could feel it — your eyes followed me like they already knew my heart. In that moment, I thought, I could go crazy for you.

Then you left for Tohana, suddenly, I missed you more than I expected. When you came back, I knew you wanted to surprise me — and yes, maybe I ruined it by guessing, but I was just too connected to you.

Later, we met again in Hisar, at Hotel Divine. Even if it was just for a short while, that day felt endless. Being with you felt like belonging — like my heart had finally found its place. I saw something in your eyes that day- I felt like you were falling too.

That’s when I knew I had to tell you everything — about my past, my fears, my mistakes. I know I’ve been wrong at times, but one thing I’m sure of — I don’t want to lose you. Not now, not ever. 💫

    <h2>💌 Chapter 5: The Heart Remembers</h2>
    <p>
     So much began from a random Saturday — a few laughs, a few drinks, and a connection I never saw coming. What we share isn’t perfect, but it’s real. From that first glance to every late-night call, every unspoken word, every moment of care — it all lives inside me. You became my peace, my chaos, and everything in between.

I don’t know what the future holds, but I know this — I’ll always remember the way you made me feel: seen, safe, and loved in the simplest ways. Maybe that’s what love really is — not grand gestures, just two people who found comfort in each other when they least expected it. 💫
